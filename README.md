# How to setup project

In order to run this project, you should have a stable internet connection, as it actively consumes OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

* Database (Running on local)
* OpenAI platform account (API key)

## Set up
1. Create `app_variables.env` file inside the root directory. It's added in .gitignore, so it would only be visible on your machine.
2. The structure of the file should look like this:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>
QUESTION_GENERATING_ASSISTANT=<OPENAI-ASSISTANT-ID>
QUESTION_ANSWERING_ASSISTANT=<OPENAI-ASSISTANT-ID>
EVALUATING_ASSISTANT=<OPENAI-ASSISTANT-ID>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<DB-USER>:<DB-PASS>@localhost:5432/<DB-NAME>
```

## OpenAI Assistants
For the purpose of the project, three OpenAI assistants were created:
